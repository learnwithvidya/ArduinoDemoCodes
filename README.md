# Ultrasonic Servo Gate (Class Demo)

This project demonstrates how to use an **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor** with a **Servo Motor** and **LED** using an **Arduino Uno** using **TinkerCad**.

When an object comes within a certain distance, the servo motor simulates a **gate opening**, and the LED lights up. After a short delay, the gate closes automatically.

## Purpose
This project is created **for classroom demonstration purposes** to help students understand:
- Ultrasonic distance measurement  
- Basic servo motor control  
- Simple conditional logic in Arduino programming

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno  
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor  
- SG90 Servo Motor  
- LED + Resistor  

## Note
This code and setup are for **educational demonstration only** and may be modified for lab or student experiments.
